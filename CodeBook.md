3. 66 variables that represent mean and standard deviations of time and frequency domain variables normalized and bounded within [-1,1]:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## CREATING AND TRANSFORMING THE VARIABLES
1. SUBJECT: this variable was created from files "subject_train.txt" and "subject_test.txt" and contains a unique identificator for 30 people participated in the experiment
2. ACTIVITY: this variable was created in two steps:
   * create a column with activity label for all activities in training and test sets
   * create ACTIVITY variable that exchanges the activity lable in the data set with the descriptive name of the activity

## CREATION OF THE TIDY DATA SET
To create a a tidy data set  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject the original data frame was grouped by
variables SUBJECT and ACTIVITY. Than the grouped data was agregated with the use of function summarise_all(mean) to find the average for all variables and all groupes difined by SUBJECT and ACTIVITY.
