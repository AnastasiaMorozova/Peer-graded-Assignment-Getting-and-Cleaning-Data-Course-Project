# Peer-graded-Assignment "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data  set that can be used for later analysis based on the raw training and testing data sets collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

## This repository contains the following files 
1. R script called **run_analysis.R** that does the following:
   * Reads data from files "X_train.txt" and "X_test.txt"
   * Creates a merged data frame from training and test data sets
   * Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
   * Assignes descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   * Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
   * Created an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
   
 2. **CodeBook.md** that contains a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations were performed to clean up the data
 
 3. **README.md**
